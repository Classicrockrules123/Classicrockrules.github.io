  The lyrics are more deep and personel
   <h1>Origins<h1/>
    <br> Rock music began in the late 1940's where the electric guitar playing from
    the most popular genres back then: Country and Blues, fused together with the bass playing of R&B,
    the vocals, horns and piano of Soul, and the drumming of Jazz. Pioneering rock artits such as Elvis
    and Chuck Berry played on a blues structure with lyrics that featured a rebellious freedom in contrast to the
    pop music at the time.<br/>

    <h2>British Invasion<h2/>
     <br> During the late 50s, and early 60s a group of rock musicians called bands were formed,
     and some of those bands helped in a new cultural phenomenon. In 1963 a then-unknown band from liverpool
     known as The Beatles released their first U.S. single, "Please Please Me." which was an ultimate success. 
     Although the band released their debut single "Love Me Do" the preceeding year in the UK,
     it didn't release in the U.S until 1964. Also, in 1964 the band released "I Want to Hold Your Hand"
     that started Beatlemania. When the band visited America then that was when other bands became insanley popular.
     Bands like the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, and the Yardbirds went on to become popular in the states.
     This started the British Invasion, and many of these bands still influence artits to this day. <br/>

     <h3>Pychedelic Rock<h3/>
      <br> Around the end of the British Invasion in the mid to late 60s the veitnam war was at its peak.
      During this a group of protesters known as hippies emerged infamous for their usage of drugs such as LSD
      To appeal to hippies a newley formed, experimental version of rock formed called pychedelic rock.
      Bands like the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones already followed this sound with Sgt. Pepper, and Their Satatnic Majesties Request
      Also during this period, two new pychedelic rock forms existed. Bands like The Doors, and Pink Floyd stayed true to the Rock N Roll at the time
      with a more experiemntal twist, while acts like Cream and The Jimi Hendrix Experience played louder, heavier disorted guitar based rock
      that would help pioneer Hard Rock and Heavy Metal in the following years.

      <h4>Heavy Metal<h4/>
       During 1968 to 1969 rock bands started to abandon their psychedelic flairs, and crank their amps to 11 playing music that
       was more lean and agressivley punching. Bands like the aftformentioned Cream already played a mix of blues and rock, but
       newcomers Led Zepplin, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath all formed. In late 1969 Sabbath begun recording their debut album. The lyrics were more darker focussing
       on drug use, the occult, and political corruption. Meanwhile in America Ronnie James Dio formed Elf and later Rainbow
       (which was founded by Purples guitarist Ritchie Blackmore), and Judas Priest also formed back in England which helped pioneer wearing obscene amounts of leather to metal.
       <h5>The 70s & 80s<h5/>
        In the 70s rock started evolve into many subgenres. During the early 70s acts like Bowie, and Slade performed wearing flamboyant costumes called Glam Rock.
        Emerging out of psychadelia came a complex version of Rock called Progressive Rock with bands like Crimson King & Yes. In the mid 70s bands like Queen & Lynyrd Skynyrd
        enjoyed mainstream sucess. During the mid to late 70s a hard edged form of rock formed called punk rock with acts like Ramones, the Sex Pistols, and the Clash.
        In 1978 party rock acts like Van Halen started to get popular and a dancable version of punk called New Wave started with acts like Blondie, and Evlis Costello.
        During the 80s even more versions of Rock formed like Glam Metal, Thrash Metal, Alternative Rock, and Post Punk.
        <h6>The 90s & 2000s<h6/>
         The 90s were a crazy time for Rock Music. Alternative Rock bands like Red Hot Chillie Peppers, and R.E.M gained mainstream sucess. It was also during this time where
         a mix of metal and punk was formed called Grunge with bands like Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam leading the way that helped demolish Glam Metal.
         In the mid-90s darker rock called Industrial Rock was formed by acts like Nine Inch Nails. Thanks to bands like Green Day and Blink-182. It was also during this time that a second
         British invasion was formed from bands like Oasis and Blur that preformed Brit Pop, a more catchy and upbeat form of Alternative Rock. In the 2000s even more bands emerged.
